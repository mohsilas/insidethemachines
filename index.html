                        <h1>Our Family Business</h1>
<p>"You know how hair and nails continue to grow even after death?" my cousin asked, staring at the emaciated corpse of a boy. "Well, tumors are like that, only worse," he continued, then unzipped its skin with a scalpel, separated the ribs' cartilage from the breastbone, and pulled open the chest like a rusty drawer. An odor with the intensity of onions thickened the air.</p>
<p>"We must remove the lungs, liver and intestines, pretty much everything and incinerate them," he spoke clearly without a face mask, a trail of lavender cream painted on the mustache beneath his nose. He extended his elbow-gloved hands with the scalpel through the chest upwards, feeling the far end of the trachea and cut it. He cut the big vessels off the lungs, and then yanked them from the fascia, sprinkling diluted blood over his shoes. He removed the heart and abdominal contents with the swiftness of a true professional. This, after all, is our family business. He asked while yanking the diaphragm, "You ever heard the true history of embalming?"</p>
<p>It started thousands of years ago sure, but in the US it wasn't until the mid 18th century when a group of med students, grave-robbing a corpse for dissection, came across the unthinkable. And that's when the big lie was spread, that corpses are infested with foulness and disease. That embalming is in the best interest of public health. Yeah right. Embalming merely started to prevent abominations from happening, but as noble as it is, it soon became a business and every body got embalmed, diseased or not.</p>
<p>"I'm not complaining or anything," he said, "but nothing's like a family trade, you can't easily buy loyalty, or silence."</p>
<p>My cousin sprayed the corpse's cavity with hydrogen peroxide, hooked its aorta with a formaldehyde-infusing tube and asked me to help him tie the leaking vessels. He then used a suction tube to void the cavity and asked if I wanted to sew it up; I nodded. "You know, I've been to a grave-digging once, that's how they initiate new embalmers," he spoke, "<em>fides est per occisionem</em>."</p>
<p>The minute they broke the casket, something crawled out. And with axes in hands they witnessed, newcomers must kill one first. And there it was, a decaying corpse with a monstrous belly tumor slathering the ground, or maybe it was a tumor with a corpse on its back. He didn't know. It crawled, slithered, maybe ran with three feet and a hand. It rolled and bounced leaving a trail of foul decaying flesh on its path. It had many eyes popping and diving in its gelatinous surface. It was like a formless clump of evil. Something truly unthinkable.</p>
<p>My cousin examined the sewing. "You're a natural, ay," he smiled, "can't wait for you to join the family business."</p>
<p>I smiled back, even more terrified to tell my family that I applied for art school.</p>
