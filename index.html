                    <h1>The Last Delivery</h1>
<p>The alarm beeps 6:30 and my mind jolts in confusion. It's my bedroom, the grey-walled white-furnished room. I hit snooze, wouldn't you? And I rolled over to snuggle by my girlfriend. She's warm, asleep, smells of flowers, and for a minute I forget where I am, maybe a cheap heaven.</p>
<p>The alarm beeps 6:40. The bliss is over. I roll outta bed, every fiber in my body protesting. My girlfriend sleepily protests. I have to get ready for work, our bill is almost due, I reply with a cheek kiss.</p>
<p>7:00 I left the apartment, feeling choked for lying to her, as always. I don't do constructions anymore, it's been months since the CP53O incident, months with the business going under. And who would keep us, a couple of humans and a fleet of faulty robots? Nobody, My boss just fired us and sold the bots.</p>
<p>7:30 I received a blacktask while having coffee. A data-packet delivery, requirements: low surveillance score. Good.</p>
<p>7:55 I arrived at the place, an underground club, a meat and bolts orgy of a club where you can't tell who's human and who's not, but who am I to judge. I'm just here to pick up a package.</p>
<p>I ruffled across the half-wasted dancing crowd to a table at the far end. As I sat, the client was notified and signaled her arrival.</p>
<p>"Nice doing business with you" said a tall blonde chick in a velvety green dress.</p>
<p>"packet?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Pragmatic, I like him," she spoke to her suited guards studying my every detail, "I am the packet," a symbol glowed in her wrist.</p>
<p>My jaw tightened. The task was labeled data-packet delivery, not bot escorting. The risk is folds higher. But If I don't pay our bill, Jane's servers would shut down in ten days. My girlfriend, Jane, would factory reset. I should‚Ä¶</p>
<p>"You're awfully quiet mister‚Ä¶" blondie asked</p>
<p>I nodded, accepting the deal. A simple delivery. I hope.</p>
<p>8:10 we moved to a quieter place upstairs, the guards debriefed me. And gave me a gun. And an autolift override key.</p>
<p>8:30 blondie and I headed for the roof where a double-seated black autolift awaits with spinning blades. All I have to do is accompany the bot downtown. We got inside.</p>
<p>"Why are you doing this?" she asked, her gray eyes matching the sky, "it's probably money." She answered herself, "but why?"</p>
<p>I kept staring at the cityscape floating below, a view only the wealthy get. Suddenly my phone ringed a familiar note. "Jane's power status: full." A familiar message.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's why," She smiled, "you like us girls" she teased. "You know, downtown is 15mins away," she touched her lips.</p>
<p>"Shut up" I replied, my jaw clenched.</p>
<p>"Uptight. What's the point?" She protested.</p>
<p>I stared in silence at my phone. Jane's familiar dashboard, Jane's everything; thoughts, dreams, and the server rent's monthly price increase notice.</p>
