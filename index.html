                        <h1>Toss A Coin</h1>
<p>A friend of mine found this old wishing well in the woods, where you can toss a coin and wish for something. Like better grades at school so you can get that scholarship you know you can't, or for the cool guys to like you, or maybe less bullying.</p>
<p>It's desperate, but you know the feeling. When you want something so bad, everything just reminds you of it. Like the ad on TV showing a guy with abs taking a shower‚Äîit was a shampoo ad, but all you see is the perfect body, the perfect hair brushing off a dazzling acne-free face. Another one was filmed like a classic 007 adventure, with lots of women, all so out of your league they probably never saw someone like you in their lives. But you know the feeling, the way you'd take any opportunity you can get, even if it sounded sketchy.</p>
<p>My friend tried it first, tossing a coin into the dark, slimy water after school. The next day, we all witnessed him argue with the chemistry teacher over quantum mechanics. He wasn't the smart type, but it's like waking up to millions of ideas neatly organized in your head. Like having a wiki for brains.</p>
<p>Another friend of mine was seen with a brand new Porsche. A high schooler with a Porsche!</p>
<p>At recess, the class dork was French kissing two cheerleaders‚Äîit's hard to argue with such results. And it was my time for a wish.</p>
<p>I felt goosebumps all over my body as I entered the woods where the well was supposed to be. It wasn't that far from the main road, but dodging exposed roots got me breathless. I fell a couple of times, the way a chubby blob of acne falls, belly first. That's when I saw it, majestically lit by sunlight through the trees.</p>
<p>I held my coins, wished as hard as I could, and tossed them.</p>
<p>It's been a few weeks, and my belly just melted away, shedding weight like magic. My acne disappeared too.</p>
<p>Everything was great until my quantum mechanics friend was found catatonic, pissing his bed. And the one with the Porsche? He's in juvenile prison. The ladies' man dork? Well, he tested HIV positive. Our school made headline after headline with all kinds of weird and troubling stories: a boy murders his whole family, girls suspected in celebrity kidnapping, SWAT team raids the school, body parts found in lockers, paranormal activity, a rabid unicorn.</p>
<p>I didn't care.</p>
<p>Not even when the fat-melting magic showed no sign of slowing down. Not even when I became a skeleton inside an oversized leather jumpsuit.</p>
<p>The doctors say they don't know.</p>
<p>I don't care.</p>
<p>I wished for the well to disappear.</p>
<p>I wished for wealth.</p>
<p>I wished for fame.</p>
<p>I wished for world peace.</p>
<p>I wished for our planet to heal, for climate change to stop.</p>
